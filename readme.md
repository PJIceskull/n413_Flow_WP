# N413 Midterm

Author: Pierce Issah

Here is my project directory that holds the theme for my midterm.

My goal was to recreate a theme based on this [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/Q59pYzAIoNNfacgY8zIDg1/Midterm-Design?node-id=2-8&t=1M1MMNrwDYoh0ygp-1) in Wordpress!. My other instructions also include:

- Utilize the theme.json and/or external styling sheets to style the website appropriately
- Create style variations based on the Figma design. This means changing the colors of the website.
